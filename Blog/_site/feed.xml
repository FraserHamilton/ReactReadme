            <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first post on React Readme and I’m going to use it to breifly describe what will be coming
on this blog and what my intentions are with it. 
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often when reading a developers blog you see them tackle a broad range of topics across many different
technologies. With React Readme I have defined a far narrower focus, choosing to instead stick to a single tehcnology. This way anyone who signs up to be notified when I post knows it’s with a technolgoy that they either use or are interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog isn’t just an educational resource for the readers it is also an educational tool for myself.
I find that in order to truly understand a concept in it’s entirety it helps to teach that infomration to
others. Not teach in the traditional sense of a teacher and a class but in a more broader way, just the re-ordering of the ideas that you have learnt on a topic can be beneficial. I’ll be encouraging my readers
to take up this practice themselves whether it be as simple as expalining the concept to a friend or even
starting their own blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can expect regular posts, roughly around 2 per week. Some may focus on interesting features within react or specific libraries. There will also be a feature in which I try and recreate a component from a site and encourage you to code along with me comparing your design choices with mine and explaining why I made those choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you stick around for this journey and learn a lot while you’re here. I’d love to hear feedback or suggestions. You can contact me on any of the social medias displayed below this post.&lt;/p&gt;
